    "text": "1 Welcome to My Coffee- and Data-Driven Blog\nMy name is Caleb J. Picker, and coffee drives my productivity. If you click my name, you will see my Curriculum Vitae. Briefly, my background is a healthy mix of academia and industry. I obtained my MA in Cognitive Psychology, and I studied Quantitiave Psychology for my PhD for a while. I then went into industry working more or less as a data analyst for the past four years. My passion is statistics, and my career aspiration is data scientist.\nIn my spare time, I like to work on my resume. Specifically, I’m engaging in several projects that I could put on my portfolio. So consider this blog as my portfolio where I demonstrate what I learn. I also currently listen to the R Weekly Podcast, and I started reading Deep Learning with R, Second Edition .\nNote, that I created everything using Quarto in RStudio. All my source code is freely available. As I continue to upskill, my code will get cleaner, my questions and analyses will become more precise, and you can watch me grow as a data scientist.\nI’m excited that I am nearly finished with my first blog post! So take a look! E-mail me or comment on the discussion posts if you have any questions, comments, feedback, or whatever! I look forward to interacting with all of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nA (Quantitative) Textual Analysis of AFI’s (A Fire Inside’s) Lyrics from their Major Album Releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "2.2 Word Frequency\nTo begin pre-processing the lyrics, I first removed lines of words that repeated (e.g., choruses), and then I removed stop words (e.g., “I”, “you”, “the”, “a”). Therefore, this section shows word frequency both with stop words (Table 1-left) and without stop words (Table 2-right). (Note: Each table is interactive and searchable!)\nAs an aside, an analysis with stop words would definitely be interesting. Davey uses pronouns and direct objects in unique ways, and that could be an entire analysis of its own: The stop words could be contextualized, for example, using ngrams.\nWithout further ado, let’s reveal AFI’s most frequently used words! Looking at Table 2 (right), it seems like the top 5 words are feel (75), love (70), eyes (60), time (55), and life (51), and heart (49).\n\n\nJoining, by = \"word\"\n\n\n\nWord frequency across AFI’s major album releases."

This allowed me to create a plot of AFI’s top 10 most frequently used words faceted by major album release. I tried my best to theme up the image and use Sing the Sorrow colors. I also tried to select colors from each album to represent the data as bars.\nFollowing on the theme, let’s look at Sing the Sorrow (the blood-red album in the second row, second column). The top 6 words are grey, tonight, dance, step, lay, inside, and heart. Grey likely comes from This Celluloid Dream (“All the colors (all grey) upon leaving (all grey) all will turn to grey.”)\nFeel free to look at the rest of the albums! It’s pretty interesting!

Gefen et al.’s (2017) process allowed me to locally and globally weight the raw frequencies. The local weighting algorithm weights words more heavily that appear more often within a song (presumably because they’re more important); the global weighting algorithm weights words less heavily if words appear more often across all songs (presumably because they’re less important, like the word “the”). These weightings were then multiplied together.\nTo start the process, I split up all the songs from the major album releases into separate text files. Then I counted the raw frequencies like before. Then I locally and globally weighted the raw frequencies. The rest of the analyses for this post rely on these weighted frequencies.\nNext, I imported all the .txt files (one .txt file is one song) to make a collection of documents called a corpus. I set the minimum global frequency to 1. There are 1758 vocabulary words and 148 songs. After that, I created several matrices that have song loadings and document loadings (similar to factor analysis). However, for brevity, I will only present the results based on cosine similarity."

    "text": "3.2 Cosine Similarity (Getting More Interesting!)\nSimilar to concepts like correlation, here I present results based on a similarity metric called cosine similarity. Cosine similarity ranges between -1 and +1:\n\ncloser to -1 means the words are more opposite,\ncloser +1 means the words are more similar, and\ncloser to 0 means the words are unrelated.\n\nNote that the diagonal contains values of 1, which means the comparison is between the word/song and itself (similar to a correlation table).\nTable 3 shows cosine similarity among all words across all albums. Table 4 shows cosine similarity among all songs. I highly recommend you explore this to your own interests. I’ll analyze a small sample from each Table to show you the cool stuff you can glean!\n\n3.2.1 Related Words\nIn this interactive table, you can use search to narrow down by rows. However, I’m interested in sorting the values based on a column. In this case, I’ll use the word “eye”. I click the column header, and I find the bottom 3 words are “awaken”, “na” and “remake” with cosine similarity ratings of -.09, -.09, and -.09 respectively. So the use of the word “heart” across all the albums is somewhat dissimilar from the use of the words “awaken”, “na” and “remake”.\nNow let’s sort in descending order. I click the column header for “eye” one more time. Aside from the word “eye” itself (cosine similarity value of 1), the top 3 words are “build”, “critic”, and “els” with cosine similarity values of +.65, +.65, and +.65.\nApparently the use of the word “eye” is more closely related to buliding (a relationship perhaps?), criticism, or they usually refer to someone else’s eyes. A deeper analysis would be necessary to understand the context and valence of how these words are used similarly.\n\n\nWarning in instance$preRenderHook(instance): It seems your data is too\nbig for client-side DataTables. You may consider server-side processing:\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/DT/server.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Related Songs\nTable 4 is similar to Table 3 in that they’re both interactive; however, the cosine similarity ratings are calculated by song rather than by word.\nAmong the major album releases, my all-time favorite album is Sing the Sorrow. It’s difficult to narrow down my favorite song because all the songs are so good. At one point in my life, my favorite song was This Celluloid Dream (Death of Seasons at another, This Time Imperfect at another, and so on!).\nSimilar to what I did for “heart” above, I used the horizontal scroll bar to find “This Celluloid Dream.txt”. The bottom 3 are in the negative category, and the top 3 are in the positive category:\n\nNegative: “Far Too Near” -.05; “Three Seconds Notice” -.05; “The Face Beneath the Waves” -.04\nPositive: “Twisted Tongues” +.14; “Strength through Wounding” +.13; “I Am Trying Very Hard to be Here” +.11\n\nApparently, This Celluloid Dreamhas some overlap with songs across their discography, and is most closely related to Twisted Tongues! This is probably because both songs use the stem ‘twist’ quite frequently (although, remember, all lines, including choruses, only show up once in my analysis).\nTell me some of the interesting things you discovered in the comment section below!"

    "text": "3.4 How Words Relate to Each Other in Latent Semantic Space\nNow let’s see how these frequent words relate to other words in the semantic space. Here, I created heatmaps of the words and their cosine similarity.\n\n3.4.1 “feel” Has Four Meanings!\nUsing the wordcloud to determine the most frequently encountered words, I started with the word “feel”.\nValues closer to dark green are more similar. Notice also the dendrograms. These dendrograms show how certain words cluster together. At the top of the dendrogram, you can see there is a split signifying there are four clusters of words. That is, feel is used to mean four different things. Note that the cosine similarity ratings are darkest green (most similar) for Cluster 1 and Cluster 2:\n\nIn Cluster 1, “feel” is related to word stems such as: “wall”, “heal”, “picture”, “strang”.\nIn Cluster 2, “feel” is related to word stems such as: “medic”, “poison”, “thorn”, “ribbon”, “gift”, “piec”, and “perfect”\nIn Cluster 3, “feel” is related to word stems such as: “ceas”, “weak”, “hope”, and “disappear”\nIn Cluster 4, “feel” is related to word stems such as: “dark”, “worse”, and “hurt”\n\n\n3.4.1.1 My Interpretation of “feel”\n“Feel” seems to be most related to confinement in an unfamiliar setting (Cluster 1) and receiving or giving gifts of poisonous pieces of oneself or others (Cluster 2), and to a lesser extent, existential struggles (Cluster 3), and painful darkness (Cluster 4). Of course, my interpretations may not be correct, so I encourage you to analyze this further!\nWhat do you think “feel” means across these different contexts?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Heatmap of the word FEEL and its relation to top 20 words in latent semantic space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 “love” Has Three Meanings!\nThis heatmap shows how “love” is used in three different ways!\n\nIn Cluster 1, love is related to word stems such as: “dare”, “drop”, “appeal”, “red”\nIn Cluster 2, “love” is related to word stems such as: “simpl”,,“sweet”, “fatal”, “lip”, “met”, “leave”, “moment”\nIn Cluster 3, “love” is related to word stems such as: “blood”, “exhale”, “trace”, “warn”, “war”, “bit”, and “yesterday”\n\n\n3.4.2.1 My Interpretation of “love”\n“Love” seems to more related (darker green) to attraction (Cluster 1) and past bloody battles (Cluster 3) and to a lesser extent, fleeting and fatal encounters (Cluster 2). Of course, my interpretations may be off, so I encourage you to analyze this further!\nHow do you see “love” being used differently across these contexts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Is “star” More Closely Related to “Born” or “Death”?\nIn this final section, I was interested in Davey’s use of the word star, as featured in songs such as Morningstar, Death of Seasons, and This Celluloid Dream. I thought “star” might signify being born or dying, so I first compare “star” to “born” and “death”.\n\n\n[1] \"Star and born have cosine similarity rating of 0.02\"\n\n\n[1] \"Star and death have cosine similarity rating of 0.22\"\n\n\nAs you can see, my guesses about what “star” means are quite off.\n\n\n3.4.4 Is “eye” more closely related to “sight” or “memory”?\nOkay, so I was interested in “eye”, too.\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and sight have cosine similarity rating of 0.21\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and vision have cosine similarity rating of 0.25\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and recal have cosine similarity rating of 0.5\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and recogn have cosine similarity rating of 0.29\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and rememb have cosine similarity rating of 0.13\"\n\n\nAs it turns out, my hypothesis that “eye”, when projected onto the semantic space, is more closely related to memory words like “recal”, “recogn”, “rememb” is somewhat supported! At the very least, eye is more closely related to memory words than sight or vision.\nIf anyone has any suggestions on what else I could analyze, feel free to let me know in the comments!"

    "text": "by Caleb J. Picker on January 18, 2023, created using Quarto in RStudio\nSing the Sorrow is my favorite album of all time. I’ve listened to it 1000s of times over the last 20 years since its release on March 11, 2003. If you’re like me and you love AFI as much as I do, then you likely also love the rest of their discography. And if you’re really like me, then you also love data science, research, and statistics.\nAs the 20th Anniversary of the Sing the Sorrow concert looms on the horizon, I was inspired to combine both of my passions to analyze the content of AFI’s lyrics from their major album releases (and to upskill my data science skillset in the realm of natural language processing).\nSo let’s see what modern statistics can reveal about the meanings of AFI’s lyrics from their major album releases!\nTo preview, I present the most frequently used words overall and by album. Then, I perform a latent semantic analysis to help uncover how co-occurrences of words relate across their discography. It’s pretty cool what this can reveal, and I can’t wait to show you. This analysis involves a word cloud, the hidden meanings of words and how they’re used in different contexts, and I select certain words that interest me and project them onto the semantic space generated by all the lyrics. For example, is the word “star” more closely related to “born” or “death”? What are “eyes” more closely related to?"

Of course, my interpretations may not be correct, so I encourage you to analyze this further!\nWhat do you think “feel” means across these different contexts?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Heatmap of the word FEEL and its relation to top 20 words in latent semantic space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 “love” Has Three Meanings!\nThis heatmap shows how “love” is used in three different ways!\n\nIn Cluster 1, love is related to word stems such as: “dare”, “drop”, “appeal”, “red”\nIn Cluster 2, “love” is related to word stems such as: “simpl”,,“sweet”, “fatal”, “lip”, “met”, “leave”, “moment”\nIn Cluster 3, “love” is related to word stems such as: “blood”, “exhale”, “trace”, “warn”, “war”, “bit”, and “yesterday”\n\n\n3.4.2.1 My Interpretation of “love”\n“Love” seems to more related (darker green) to attraction (Cluster 1) and past bloody battles (Cluster 3) and to a lesser extent, fleeting and fatal encounters (Cluster 2). Of course, my interpretations may be off, so I encourage you to analyze this further!\nHow do you see “love” being used differently across these contexts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Is “star” More Closely Related to “Born” or “Death”?\nIn this final section, I was interested in Davey’s use of the word star, as featured in songs such as Morningstar, Death of Seasons, and This Celluloid Dream. I thought “star” might signify being born or dying, so I first compare “star” to “born” and “death”.\n\n\n[1] \"Star and born have cosine similarity rating of 0.02\"\n\n\n[1] \"Star and death have cosine similarity rating of 0.22\"\n\n\nAs you can see, my guesses about what “star” means are quite off.\n\n\n3.4.4 Is “eye” more closely related to “sight” or “memory”?\nOkay, so I was interested in “eye”, too.\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and sight have cosine similarity rating of 0.21\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and vision have cosine similarity rating of 0.25\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and recal have cosine similarity rating of 0.5\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and recogn have cosine similarity rating of 0.29\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and rememb have cosine similarity rating of 0.13\"\n\n\nAs it turns out, my hypothesis that “eye”, when projected onto the semantic space, is more closely related to memory words like “recal”, “recogn”, “rememb” is somewhat supported! At the very least, eye is more closely related to memory words than sight or vision.\nIf anyone has any suggestions on what else I could analyze, feel free to let me know in the comments!"
