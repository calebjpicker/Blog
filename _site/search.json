    "text": "2.2 Word Frequency\nTo get to a more meaningful output, I pre-processed the lyrics. I first removed lines of words that repeated (e.g., choruses), and then I removed stop words (e.g., “I”, “you”, “the”, “a”). So you can see for yourself, this section shows word frequency both with stop words (Table 2-left) and without stop words (Table 3-right).\nAs an aside, an analysis with stop words would definitely be interesting. Davey uses pronouns and direct objects in unique ways, and that could be an entire analysis of its own: The stop words could be contextualized, for example, using ngrams.\nWithout further ado, let’s reveal AFI’s most frequently used words! Looking at Table 3 (right), it seems like the top six words are:\n\nfeel (75); love (70); eyes (60); time (55); life (51); and heart (49).\n\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\n\nJoining, by = \"word\"\n\n\n\nWord frequency across AFI’s major album releases."

    "text": "2.4 Top 10 Most Frequently Used Words (by Album)\nTo round out the word frequency topic, I created a plot of AFI’s top 10 most frequently used words faceted by major album release (following https://drsimonj.svbtle.com/ordering-categories-within-ggplot2-facets). I themed up the image to use Sing the Sorrow colors and by selecting colors from each album to represent the data as bars.\nFollowing on the Sing the Sorrow theme, let’s look at Sing the Sorrow (the blood-red album in the second row, second column). The top six words are:\n\ngrey, tonight, dance, step, lay, inside, and heart\n\nGrey likely comes from This Celluloid Dream (“All the colors (all grey) upon leaving (all grey) all will turn to grey.”)\nFeel free to look at the rest of the albums! It’s pretty interesting! Let me know what else you discover in a comment on the Discussion page!\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Word frequency by each of AFI’s albums"

    "text": "3.1 Technical Details\nIf you’re not into technical details, feel free to skip this section and go straight to Cosine Similarity. Gefen et al.’s (2017) process allowed me to locally and globally weight the raw frequencies. The local weighting algorithm weights words more heavily that appear more often within a song (presumably because they’re more important); the global weighting algorithm weights words less heavily if words appear more often across all songs (presumably because they’re less important, like the word “the”). These weightings were then multiplied together.\nTo start the process, I split up all the songs from the major album releases into separate text files. After importing them, I created a Term-Document-Matrix and first, counted the raw frequencies and second, locally and globally weighted those frequencies. The rest of the analyses for this post rely on these weighted frequencies.\nWhile importing the files, I set the minimum global frequency to 2. There are 698 vocabulary words and 147 songs. After that, I created a cosine similarity matrix to examine how related certain words are together. Finally, I examined the hidden themes by creating a matrix with word loadings (similar to factor analysis)."

    "section": "3.2 Cosine Similarity",
    "text": "3.2 Cosine Similarity\nSimilar to concepts like correlation, cosine similarity also measures similarity by measuring the distance between two vectors in semantic space. Cosine similarity ranges between -1 and +1:\n\ncloser to -1 means the words are more opposite,\ncloser +1 means the words are more similar, and\ncloser to 0 means the words are unrelated.\n\n\n3.2.1 Related Words\nIn this interactive table, I’m interested in sorting the values based on a column. In this case, I’ll use the word eye. I click the column header twice, and I find the top three words (cosine similarity) are:\n\nstare (+.53); recal (+.49); and meet (+.47)\n\nIt looks like the use of the word eye is closely related to staring, as well as to recalling (a memory). Interesting!\n\n\nWarning in instance$preRenderHook(instance): It seems your data is too\nbig for client-side DataTables. You may consider server-side processing:\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/DT/server.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Is eye more closely related to sight or to memory?\nThe follow up question is whether eye is more closely related to sight or to memory words.\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and sight have cosine similarity rating of 0.2\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and recal have cosine similarity rating of 0.48\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and recogn have cosine similarity rating of 0.22\"\n\n\n[1] \"Eye and rememb have cosine similarity rating of 0.13\"\n\n\nAs it turns out, my hypothesis that eye, when projected onto the semantic space, is more closely related to memory words like recal, recogn, rememb is somewhat supported!\nWhat else would you like to see?

    "section": "3.3 Hidden Themes",
    "text": "3.3 Hidden Themes\nOne of the key features of latent semantic analysis is that it can reveal hidden themes that one otherwise may not have noticed. This is demonstrated in the word loadings matrix. The full set is here for you to play with (Table 5), but I’ve also extracted the top five words for all dimensions in the Table 6.\nHere, I will present all factors from the analysis, but I will only analyze three of the hidden themes. The approach I took was to find hidden themes that were easier for me to interpret to better demonstrate the power of this analysis. The hidden themes are labeled V1 to V50, so feel free to explore to your heart’s content. In my estimation, the hidden themes aren’t so straightforward, so some help interpreting them would be welcomed! Feel free to post your findings in the Discussion forum!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6 extracts the top five words (and their loadings) for each of the themes to make interpretation easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Hidden Theme 1: Love is Red Blood\nFor hidden theme 1, I analyzed (V3):\n\nTop 5: drop (+18.59); red (+15.88); love (+15.27); tast (+11.61); life (+7.45)\n\nThe first hidden theme seems to relate to red drops that signify love and tasting life. Two songs come to mind: She Speaks the Language with the line “Red, red drops upon my cuff let me know this must be love”.\nSo the use of these top 5 words make the connection between love and blood, so every drop of blood spilled is love spilling out of his body.\n\n\n3.3.2 Hidden Theme 2: Forever Crawling We Rewind\nFor hidden theme 2 (V26), I find the top 5 words:\n\nTop 5: crawl (+11.78); forever (+11.40); float (+11.29); dream (+10.71); and meet (+9.06)\n\nThe second hidden theme seems to relate to forever crawling and floating in a dream. This reminds me of the song Rewind: “feel it crawl up on your chest…stay awake as its creeping close”, “Let the ghost that meets your eyes still haunt you, remind you”, “Your selfish words must float denied like your crime, I float now”, and “Forever crawling, ever crawling”.\n\n\n3.3.3 Hidden Theme 3: Bathed in Your Radiance I Melt\nFor hidden theme 3 (V6), I find:\n\nTop 5: twist (+12.34); melt (+12.14); gonna (+11.17); light (+10.76); and star (+10.06)\n\nThe third hidden theme seems to relate to twist and melting by the light of a star. This Celluloid Dream comes to mind with the lines: “Just like a memory, it twists me”; “bathed in your radiance I melt”; and “in the shadow of a star in static pallor”. So this could mean, at least within the context of this song, Davey compares his lack of radiance (static pallor) to his twisted memory of the radiance of his star who radiates light that melts him."
