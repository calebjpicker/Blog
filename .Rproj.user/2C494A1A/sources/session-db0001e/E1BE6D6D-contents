# About this blog

My name is [Caleb J. Picker](https://calebjpicker.quarto.pub/ "Caleb J. Picker's Curriculum Vitae"), and coffee drives my productivity. If you click my name, you will see my [Curriculum Vitae](https://calebjpicker.quarto.pub/). Briefly, my background is a healthy mix of academia and industry. I obtained my MA in Cognitive Psychology, and I studied Quantitative Psychology for my PhD for a while. I then went into industry working more or less as a data analyst for the past four years. My passion is statistics, and my career aspiration is data scientist.

In my spare time, I like to work on my learning skills. Specifically, I'm engaging in several projects. I plan to use this blog as my portfolio where I demonstrate what I learn.

I also currently listen to the [R Weekly Podcast](https://rweekly.org/), and I started reading [Deep Learning with R, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r-second-edition).

Note, that I created everything using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) in RStudio. All my source code is freely available. Please feel free to follow my journey as I grow to become a data scientist.

[E-mail me](mailto:%20caleb.j.picker@gmail.com) or comment on the discussion posts if you have any questions, comments, feedback, or whatever! I look forward to interacting with all of you.
