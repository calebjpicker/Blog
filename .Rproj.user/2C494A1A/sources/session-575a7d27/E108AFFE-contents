# Welcome to My Coffee- and Data-Driven Blog

My name is [Caleb J. Picker](https://calebjpicker.quarto.pub/ "Caleb J. Picker's Curriculum Vitae"), and coffee drives my productivity. If you click my name, you will see my Curriculum Vitae. Briefly, my background is a healthy mix of academia and industry. I obtained my MA in Cognitive Psychology, and I studied Quantitiave Psychology for my PhD for a while. I then went into industry working more or less as a data analyst for the past four years. My passion is statistics, and my career aspiration is data scientist.

In my spare time, I like to work on my resume. Specifically, I'm engaging in several projects that I could put on my portfolio. So consider this blog as my portfolio where I demonstrate what I learn. I also currently listen to the [R Weekly Podcast](https://rweekly.org/), and I started reading [Deep Learning with R, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r-second-edition) .

Note, that I created everything using Quarto in RStudio. All my source code is freely available. As I continue to upskill, my code will get cleaner, my questions and analyses will become more precise, and you can watch me grow as a data scientist.

I'm excited that I am nearly finished with my first blog post! So take a look! [E-mail me](mailto:%20caleb.j.picker@gmail.com) or comment on the discussion posts if you have any questions, comments, feedback, or whatever! I look forward to interacting with all of you.
